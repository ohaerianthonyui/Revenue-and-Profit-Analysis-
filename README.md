   - Invest in the Furniture category to further enhance profitability, while also exploring strategies to increase revenue from the Clothing category, as it generated the most sales.

3. **Leverage Sales Representatives:**
   - Reward and incentivize top-performing sales reps like David and Eve to maintain motivation and performance, while offering training and development opportunities to other sales representatives.

4. **Target New Customers:**
   - As new customers contributed significantly to overall sales and profits, focus on targeted marketing campaigns aimed at attracting new customers in 2024.

5. **Regional Focus:**
   - Explore strategies to improve sales and profitability in the Southern region, which showed lower profitability, potentially through local promotions or optimized product offerings for that region.

6. **Monitor 2024 Progress:**
